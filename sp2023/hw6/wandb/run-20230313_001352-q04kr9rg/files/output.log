Some weights of the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased were not used when initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification: ['vocab_layer_norm.bias', 'vocab_transform.weight', 'vocab_layer_norm.weight', 'vocab_transform.bias', 'vocab_projector.weight', 'vocab_projector.bias']
- This IS expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing DistilBertForSequenceClassification from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of DistilBertForSequenceClassification were not initialized from the model checkpoint at distilbert-base-uncased and are newly initialized: ['pre_classifier.weight', 'classifier.bias', 'classifier.weight', 'pre_classifier.bias']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
